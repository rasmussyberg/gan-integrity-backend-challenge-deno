# GAN Integrity Backend Code Challenge

This repository contains the implementation for the GAN Integrity backend code challenge. The challenge involves creating an API that performs various operations on a set of cities, with the script `index.js` using this API to execute the operations.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have Deno installed. If you haven't installed Deno, you can find installation instructions at [Deno Installation Guide](https://deno.land/#installation).

Once Deno is installed, you can start the project using the following command:

```
deno task dev
```

## API Implementation

The API implementation is designed to work with the data provided in [addresses.json](https://chat.openai.com/c/addresses.json) and includes distance calculations based on the assumption that the Earth is a perfect sphere with a radius of 6371 km.

## Usage

You can start the project using Deno as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section. Once the API is up and running, the `index.js` script provided by GAN Integrity will be able to interact with it to perform various operations on the city data.

## License

This project is unlicensed. See the [LICENSE](https://chat.openai.com/c/LICENSE) file for details.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to GAN Integrity for providing this code challenge.
